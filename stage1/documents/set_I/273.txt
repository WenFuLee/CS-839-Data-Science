F W Murnau s German silent classic The Last Laugh ( Der Letze Mann ) stars Emil Jannings as the doorman of a posh Berlin hotel Fiercely proud of his job , Jannings comports himself like a general in his resplendent costume , and is treated like royalty by his friends and neighbors The hotel s insensitive new manager , noting that Jannings seems winded after carrying several heavy pieces of luggage for a patron , decides that the old man is no longer up to his job The manager demotes Jannings to men s washroom attendant , and the effect is disastrous on the man s prestige and self esteem Logically , the film should end on a note of tragedy , but Murnau ( either because he was ordered to by the producers or because he just felt like it ) adds a near surrealistic coda , wherein Jannings , having suddenly inherited a fortune , returns to the hotel in triumph The Last Laugh was a bold experiment for its time : a film told entirely visually , with no subtitles save for the semi satirical explanation of the climax In a sense , Karl Freund s camera is as much a " character " as anyone else , commenting upon Jannings rise and fall via then revolutionary camera angles , jarring movements and grotesque lens distortions Many historians credit The Last Laugh as the vanguard of the " German invasion " of Hollywood during the mid to late 1920s ~ Hal Erickson , Rovi
