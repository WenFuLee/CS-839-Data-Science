From award winning director Keiichi Hara ( Colorful ) and Japanese powerhouse Production I G ( creators of Ghost in the Shell ) comes a remarkable story of the daughter behind one of history s most famous artists As all of Edo flocks to see the work of the revered painter Hokusai , his daughter O Ei toils diligently inside his studio Her masterful portraits , dragons and erotic sketches sold under the name of her father are coveted by upper crust Lords and journeyman print makers alike Shy and reserved in public , in the studio O Ei is as brash and uninhibited as her father , smoking a pipe while sketching drawings that would make contemporary Japanese ladies blush But despite this fiercely independent spirit , O Ei struggles under the domineering influence of her father and is ridiculed for lacking the life experience that she is attempting to portray in her art Miss Hokusai s bustling Edo ( present day Tokyo ) is filled with yokai spirits , dragons , and conniving tradesmen , while O Ei s relationships with her demanding father and blind younger sister provide a powerful emotional underpinning to this sumptuously animated coming of age tale
