Set in Germany and France in the immediate aftermath of the First World War , ( 1914 1918 ) , Frantz recalls the mourning period that follows great national tragedies as seen through the eyes of the war s " lost generation " : Anna ( 21 year old Paula Beer in a breakthrough performance ) , a bereft young German woman whose fianc√© , Frantz , was killed during trench warfare , and Adrien ( Pierre Niney , Yves Saint Laurent ) , a French veteran of the war who shows up mysteriously in her town , placing flowers on Frantz s grave Adrien s presence is met with resistance by the small community still reeling from Germany s defeat , yet Anna gradually gets closer to the handsome and melancholy young man , as she learns of his deep friendship with Frantz , conjured up in evocative flashbacks What follows is a surprising exploration of how Ozon s characters wrestle with their conflicting feelings survivor s guilt , anger at one s losses , the overriding desire for happiness despite everything that has come before , and the longing for sexual , romantic and familial attachments Ozon drew his inspiration from Ernst Lubitsch s 1932 drama Broken Lullaby , with stunning visual references to painter Caspar David Friedrich
