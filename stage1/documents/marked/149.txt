Unbeknownst to the public, <>Marlon Brando<\> - a great star who remained deliberately mysterious to the press and the world at large for his entire professional life - created a vast archive of personal audio and visual materials over the course of his lifetime, often deeply confessional and completely without vanity or evasion. Now - for the first time ever - those recordings come to life in <>Riley<\> 's film. Charting his exceptional career as an actor and his extraordinary life away from the stage and screen, the film reveals the complexities and contradictions that were <>Marlon Brando<\> by telling the story in his own words - and only his own words, revealing a man more humane and compelling than anyone ever could have imagined.
