Stepping from the pages of <>Fredrik Backman<\> 's international best-selling novel, <>Ove<\> is the quintessential angry old man next door. An isolated retiree with strict principles and a short fuse, who spends his days enforcing block association rules that only he cares about, and visiting his wife's grave, <>Ove<\> has given up on life. Enter a boisterous young family next door who accidentally flattens <>Ove<\> 's mailbox while moving in and earning his special brand of ire. Yet from this inauspicious beginning an unlikely friendship forms and we come to understand <>Ove<\> 's past happiness and heartbreaks. What emerges is a heartwarming tale of unreliable first impressions and the gentle reminder that life is sweeter when it's shared.
