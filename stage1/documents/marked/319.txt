Every day, editorial obituary writers deposit the details of a handful of extraordinary lives into the cultural memory--each life's story spun amid the daily beat of war, politics, and football scores. Obit. is the first documentary to explore the world of these remarkable writers and their subjects, focusing on a small team at The New York Times who approach their work with journalistic rigor and narrative flair. Going beyond the byline and into the minds of those chronicling life after death on the freshly inked front lines of history, the film invites some of the most essential questions we ask ourselves about life, memory, and the inevitable passage of time. What do we choose to remember? What never dies?
