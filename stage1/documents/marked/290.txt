A visually spectacular drama from director <>J.A. Bayona<\> ("The Impossible"). 12-year-old <>Conor<\> ( <>Lewis MacDougall<\> ), dealing with his mother's ( <>Felicity Jones<\> ) illness, a less-than-sympathetic grandmother (<>Sigourney Weaver<\>), and bullying classmates, finds a most unlikely ally when a Monster appears at his bedroom window. Ancient, wild, and relentless, the Monster guides <>Conor<\> on a journey of courage, faith, and truth. <>Toby Kebbell<\> plays <>Conor<\> 's father, and <>Liam Neeson<\> stars in performance-capture and voiceover as the nocturnally visiting Monster of the title.
