After stumbling upon a bizarre "competitive endurance tickling" video online, wherein young men are paid to be tied up and tickled, reporter <>David Farrier<\> reaches out to request a story from the company. But the reply he receives is shocking-the sender mocks <>Farrier<\> 's sexual orientation and threatens extreme legal action should he dig any deeper. So, like any good journalist confronted by a bully, he does just the opposite: he travels to the hidden tickling facilities in Los Angeles and uncovers a vast empire, known for harassing and harming the lives of those who protest their involvement in these films. The more he investigates, the stranger it gets, discovering secret identities and criminal activity. Discovering the truth becomes <>Farrier<\> 's obsession, despite increasingly sinister threats and warnings. With humor and determination, <>Farrier<\> and co-director <>Dylan Reeve<\> summon up every resource available to get to the bottom of this tickling worm hole.
