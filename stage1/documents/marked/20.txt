<>Denzel Washington<\> directed and stars in this adaptation of <>August Wilson<\> 's <>Pulitzer<\> Prize-winning play, which centers on a black garbage collector named <>Troy Maxson<\> in 1950s Pittsburgh. Bitter that baseball's color barrier was only broken after his own heyday in the Negro Leagues, <>Maxson<\> is prone to taking out his frustrations on his loved ones. Both <>Washington<\> and co-star <>Viola Davis<\> won Tonys for their performances in the 2010 revival of the play. <>Stephen Henderson<\> , <>Jovan Adepo<\> , <>Russell Hornsby<\> , and <>Mykelti Williamson<\> round out the supporting cast.
