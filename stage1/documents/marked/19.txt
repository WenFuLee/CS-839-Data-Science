Raised on hip-hop and foster care, defiant city kid <>Ricky<\> gets a fresh start in the New Zealand countryside. He quickly finds himself at home with his new foster family: the loving <>Aunt Bella<\> , the cantankerous Uncle <>Hec<\> , and dog <>Tupac<\> . When a tragedy strikes that threatens to ship <>Ricky<\> to another home, both he and Hec go on the run in the bush. As a national manhunt ensues, the newly branded outlaws must face their options: go out in a blaze of glory or overcome their differences and survive as a family. Equal parts road comedy and rousing adventure story, director <>Taika Waititi<\> (WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS, upcoming <>THOR<\> : RAGNORAK) masterfully weaves lively humor with emotionally honest performances by <>Sam Neill<\> and <>Julian Dennison<\> . A hilarious, touching crowd-pleaser, HUNT FOR THE WILDERPEOPLE reminds us about the journey that growing up is (at any age) and those who help us along the way.
