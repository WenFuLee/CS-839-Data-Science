ALL THIS PANIC takes an intimate look at the interior lives of a group of teenage girls as they come of age in Brooklyn. A potent mix of vivid portraiture and vérité, we follow the girls as they navigate the ephemeral and fleeting transition between childhood and adulthood. Shot over a three-year period in a lush and cinematic style, ALL THIS PANIC is a meditation on the mysterious, often painful, yet ultimately exhilarating period of a teen's life. In a world where, as one teen remarks 'they want to see us, but they don't want to hear us' this film is comprised entirely of young women speaking to their own experiences. ALL THIS PANIC centers on the complex transition that all young women experience in their formative teenage years, focusing on the trauma of moving from the relative protection of childhood into a more independent, less-structured future that's theirs to embrace as more mature versions of their teen selves.
