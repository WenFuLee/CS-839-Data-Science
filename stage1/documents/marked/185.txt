Drawing from over 100 hours of never-before-seen footage that has been tucked away in the National Geographic archives for over 50 years, award-winning director <>Brett Morgen<\> tells the story of <>JANE<\> , a woman whose chimpanzee research challenged the male-dominated scientific consensus of her time and revolutionized our understanding of the natural world. Set to a rich orchestral score from legendary composer Philip Glass, the film offers an unprecedented, intimate portrait of <>Jane Goodall<\> - a trailblazer who defied the odds to become one of the world's most admired conservationists.
