Everybody Loves Raymond co star Brad Garrett brings " The Great One " to life in this made for TV biography of video icon Jackie Gleason The product of a fractious Brooklyn childhood , capped by the abrupt desertion of his ne er do well father , Gleason launches his show business career with the motto " Never depend on anyone " Yet because of his multitude of insecurities , he demands total loyalty and 100 percent devotion from everyone around him Trouble is , he has no loyalty or devotion to give in return : Dedicated to his career , his drinking , and his womanizing ( not always in that order ) , Jackie neglects his wife Gen ( Gretchen Egolf ) and his children , tyrannizes his associates in general and his faithful agent George " Bullets " Durgom ( Saul Rubinek ) in particular , and shamelessly steals other people s ideas and comedy material , claiming it exclusively as his own For all his bluster and bullying , Gleason remains likable and arguably even lovable just like his most famous TV character , Brooklyn bus driver Ralph Kramden ( indeed , the script suggests that Gleason was Kramden and Kramden was Gleason and that Jackie was envious of Ralph s ability to " make things up " to his long suffering wife Alice at the end of each Honeymooners sketch ) The film is at its best in its re creations of Gleason s stage and TV triumphs , though one could nitpick about the hazy and often downright inaccurate chronology of events As the title character , Brad Garrett offers an uncannily on target portrayal , despite the fact that the 6 8 " actor was nearly a foot taller than the real Gleason ( this discrepancy was amply compensated for by the clever camera angles of cinematographer Neil Roach , not to mention the elevator shoes worn by practically every other member of the cast ) Of the supporting players , Gretchen Egolf and Terry Farrell are superb as Jackie s first and second wives respectively , while Michael Chieffo s portrayal of Art Carney is eerily perfect Co written by Michael Preminger and Rick Podell , the same team responsible for Jackie Gleason s final theatrical feature Nothing in Common , Gleason made its CBS network debut on October 13 , 2002
