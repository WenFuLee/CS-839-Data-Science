A suburban homeowner becomes obsessed with the secretive family next door in this independent drama. Norman (Steven Weber) is an airline pilot who one day discovers he has new neighbors when he hears them moving into a nearby house during the dark of night. While Norman soon learns that Dr. Peoples (Eriq La Salle) is a psychiatrist, he can't figure out much else about him, beyond the fact he only mows his lawn after the sun goes down. Eager to uncover the enigma of the folks next door, Norman becomes friendly with Maria (Nia Peeples), the doctor's wife, and reaches out to their phobic son, Obert (Tyler Posey), but Dr. Peoples himself remains a mystery. As time goes on, Norman also discovers he's not the only one in the neighborhood eager to know more about the mysterious new arrivals. Inside Out was the first feature film for writer and director David Ogden.
