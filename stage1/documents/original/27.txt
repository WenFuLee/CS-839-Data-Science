The moral implications of modern warfare are confronted in Bleecker Street's powerful drama, Eye in the Sky, coming to Digital HD on June 14, 2016 and Blu-ray(TM), DVD and On Demand on June 28, 2016, from Universal Pictures Home Entertainment. Tackling an ethical dilemma in a thought-provoking suspenseful story, the gritty film stars Academy Award (R) Winner, Helen Mirren (Trumbo, The Queen), Aaron Paul ("Breaking Bad," Need for Speed), Academy Award (R) Nominee Barkhad Abdi (Captain Philips), Iain Glen ("Game of Thrones," Lara Croft: Tomb Raider) and the late Alan Rickman (Die Hard, Harry Potter) in his final on-screen performance. Eye in the Sky "holds us in a vise and keeps squeezing" according to Peter Travers of Rolling Stone. Directed by Academy Award (R) Winner Gavin Hood (Tsotsi, Ender's Game) and written by Guy Hibbert ("Complicit," Five Minutes of Heaven), Eye in the Sky follows Colonel Katherine Powell (Helen Mirren), a UK-based military officer in command of a top secret drone operation to capture terrorists in Kenya. Using remote surveillance and on-the-ground intelligence, Powell discovers the targets are planning a suicide bombing and the mission escalates from "capture" to "kill." But as American pilot Steve Watts (Aaron Paul) is about to engage, a nine-year-old girl enters the kill zone triggering an international dispute, reaching the highest levels of American and British government, over the moral, political and personal implications of modern military operations.
