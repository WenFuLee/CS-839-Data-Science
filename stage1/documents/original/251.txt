An amnesiac woman seeks out the clues to her mysterious past after awakening in France with 2 million, a nasty scar, and a gang of menacing men hot on her trail. Narrowly escaping her pursuers with the help of a kindly hotelier, the woman traces her roots back to Denmark, where she meets an opera singer who helps her to unlock the enigma of her identity. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi
