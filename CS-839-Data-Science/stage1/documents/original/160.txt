Like most teenage girls, Minnie Goetze (Bel Powley) is longing for love, acceptance and a sense of purpose in the world. Minnie begins a complex love affair with her mother's (Kristen Wiig) boyfriend, "the handsomest man in the world," Monroe Rutherford (Alexander Skarsg√•rd). What follows is a sharp, funny and provocative account of one girl's sexual and artistic awakening, without judgment. (C) Sony Classics
