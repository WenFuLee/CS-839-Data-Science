Winner of the Un Certain Regard prize at this year's Cannes Film Festival and Best Narrative Feature at the Hampton's Film Festival, this charming, stunningly shot drama focuses on two Icelandic sheep farmers whose decades-long feud comes to a head when disaster strikes their flocks. In a secluded valley, estranged brothers Gummi and Kiddi live side by side tending to their prized ancestral sheep stock, despite not having spoken in 40 years. When a lethal disease suddenly infects Kiddi's sheep, all the animals in the area are culled to contain the outbreak, with many farmers abandoning their land. But the brothers don't give up so easily-and each tries to stave off the disaster in his own fashion: Kiddi by using his rifle and Gummi by using his wits. As the authorities close in, they will need to come together to save the special breed passed down for generations-and themselves-from extinction.
