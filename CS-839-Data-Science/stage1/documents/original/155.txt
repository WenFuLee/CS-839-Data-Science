In 1962, Alfred Hitchcock and a 30-year-old Fran√ßois Truffaut sequestered themselves in a windowless Hollywood office for a weeklong conversation. The result: the seminal book "Hitchcock/Truffaut," published a half century ago, dissecting every film Hitchcock had made until then, illuminating his masterful techniques, making the case for the popular director as an artist, and influencing generations of filmmakers. Kent Jones brings "the Bible of Cinema" to invigorating life. He interviews filmmakers whose work has been profoundly influenced by Hitchcock-Martin Scorsese, David Fincher, Richard Linklater, Olivier Assayas, and many others.
