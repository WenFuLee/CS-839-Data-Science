BLACK SOULS ("Anime Nere") is a gripping morality tale of violence begetting violence in rural Calabria, that takes us on a journey into the dark and sinister world of the real-life mafia ('Ndrangheta) in Southern Italy. Based upon the actual events described in <>Gioacchino Criaco<\> 's novel of the same name, Black Souls vividly brings to life the inevitable tragic consequences when never-ending revenge and vendetta is passed down from generation to generation. The film focuses in on the Carbone family that consists of three brothers, <>Luigi<\> ( <>Marco Leonardi<\> ) & <>Rocco<\> ( <>Peppino Mazzotta<\> ) who are engaged in the family business of international drug trade, and <>Luciano<\> ( <>Fabrizio Ferracane<\> ) who has remained behind herding goats in their ancestral town of Africo in the remote Aspromonte mountains on the Ionic coast. <>Luciano<\> 's 20-year old son <>Leo<\> ( <>Giuseppe Fumo<\> ) has little respect for his father's simple ways and instead idealizes his two Mafioso uncles and their urban lifestyle. When <>Leo<\> shoots up a local bar owned by a rival family, his reckless actions reignites a longstanding blood feud and sets off a tragic chain of events that violently grinds toward an inevitable bloody showdown for all involved.(C) Vitagraph
