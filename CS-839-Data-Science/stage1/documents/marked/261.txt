Deep in the heart of New York's ultra-orthodox Hasidic Jewish community, <>Menashe<\> --a kind, hapless grocery store clerk--struggles to make ends meet and responsibly parent his young son, <>Rieven<\> , following his wife <>Leah<\> 's death. Tradition prohibits <>Menashe<\> from raising his son alone, so <>Rieven<\> 's strict uncle adopts him, leaving <>Menashe<\> heartbroken. Meanwhile, though <>Menashe<\> seems to bungle every challenge in his path, his rabbi grants him one special week with <>Rieven<\> before <>Leah<\> 's memorial. It's his chance to prove himself a suitable man of faith and fatherhood, and restore respect among his doubters.
