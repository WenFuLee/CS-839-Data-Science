A pitch black, wryly British comedy from the mind of <>Alice Lowe<\> , "Prevenge" follows <>Ruth<\> , a pregnant woman on a killing spree that's as funny as it is vicious. It's her misanthropic unborn baby dictating <>Ruth<\> 's actions, holding society responsible for the absence of a father. The child speaks to <>Ruth<\> from the womb, coaching her to lure and ultimately kill her unsuspecting victims. Struggling with her conscience, loneliness, and a strange strain of prepartum madness, <>Ruth<\> must ultimately choose between redemption and destruction at the moment of motherhood. "Prevenge" marks the directorial debut from <>Lowe<\> , who is a triple threat, writing, directing, and acting in the film during her own pregnancy. Prevenge opens theatrically in New York and Los Angeles, and will be available nationwide on Shudder, on March 24th.
