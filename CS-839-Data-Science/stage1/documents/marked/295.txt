In 1854 Utah, 13-year old <>Nick Wilson<\> ( <>Blake Heron<\> ), bored by life on the family farm with his widowed mother ( <>Karen Allen<\> ), accepts an invitation to join a local Shoshone tribe. The Indians are anxious to have the boy among them because he fulfills the prescient dreams of one of the elders, <>Anuba<\> ( <>Patricia Van Ingen<\> ); <>Nick<\> is just happy to have the adventure. He undergoes training to become a Shoshone warrior, and his ability to shoot an arrow comes in handy as a rival tribe -- led by the fearsome <>Pocatello<\> ( <>Wes Studi<\> ) -- and a posse of white men bring danger to his newly adopted family.
