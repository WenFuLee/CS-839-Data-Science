WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS chronicles the adventures of four vampire roommates trying to get by in a modern world that's not always hospitable to the undead. <>Clement<\> and <>Waititi<\>, creators of the HBO hit series "Flight of the Conchords," co-wrote, co-directed, and co-star in this hilarious send-up in which an endearingly unhip quartet of friends reveal to us or, rather, to the documentary crew that's filming them, the details of their daily-make that nightly-routine. Ranging in age from 183 to 8,000, and in appearance from adorably youthful to Nosferatu-crusty, they squabble over household chores, struggle to keep up with the latest trends in technology and fashion, antagonize the local werewolves, cruise clubs for lovely ladies, and deal with the rigors of living on a very, very strict diet. The film also stars <>Rhys Darby<\>, <>Jonathan Brugh<\>, <>Cori Gonzalez-Macuer<\>, <>Stu Rutherford<\>, and <>Jackie Van Beek<\>, and was produced by <>Waititi<\>, <>Chelsea Winstanley<\> and <>Emanuel Michael<\>.
