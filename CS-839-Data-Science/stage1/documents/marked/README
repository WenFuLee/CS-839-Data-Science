In this stage, the entity we tried to extract from the texts is "Person name".
We put <> ahead of the person name and <\> after it. So the marked person name should look like <>....<\>.

If the end of the person name concatenate with non-alphabetic characters, we added a space between the end of the word and the special character. The following are some examples.

Ex. 1
(In Raw text)
Now that Chris and his girlfriend

(In Marked text)
Now that <>Chris<\> and his girlfriend

Ex. 2
(In Raw text)
Now that Chris and his girlfriend, Rose, have reached....

(In Marked text)
Now that <>Chris<\> and his girlfriend, <>Rose<\> , have reached ....
