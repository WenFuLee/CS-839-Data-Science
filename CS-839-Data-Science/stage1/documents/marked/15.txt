<>Paterson<\> is a bus driver in the city of <>Paterson<\> , New Jersey--they share the name. Every day, <>Paterson<\> adheres to a simple routine: he drives his daily route, observing the city as it drifts across his windshield and overhearing fragments of conversation swirling around him; he writes poetry into a notebook; he walks his dog; he stops in a bar and drinks exactly one beer; he goes home to his wife, <>Laura<\> . By contrast, <>Laura<\> 's world is ever changing. New dreams come to her almost daily. <>Paterson<\> loves <>Laura<\> and she loves him. He supports her newfound ambitions; she champions his gift for poetry. The film quietly observes the triumphs and defeats of daily life, along with the poetry evident in its smallest details.
