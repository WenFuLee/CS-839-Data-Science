<>Agnès Varda<\> and <>JR<\> have things in common: a passion for and the exploration of images in general, and more precisely, for places and for ways of showing, sharing, and exhibiting them. <>Agnès<\> chose cinema. <>JR<\> chose to create open air photography galleries. When <>Agnès<\> and <>JR<\> met in 2015, they immediately wanted to work together, to shoot a film in France, far from cities, during a trip in <>JR<\> 's photographic (and magical) truck. Through chance encounters and prepared projects, they reached out to others, listening to them, photographing them, and sometimes putting them on posters. This film also tells the story of <>Agnès<\> and <>JR<\> 's friendship, which grew stronger throughout the film shoot, between surprises and teasing, and while laughing about their differences.
