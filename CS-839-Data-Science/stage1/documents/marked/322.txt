This wry, melancholic comedy from <>Aki Kaurismäki<\> , a clear-eyed response to the current refugee crisis, follows two people searching for a place to call home. Displaced Syrian <>Khaled<\> ( <>Sherwan Haji<\> ) lands in Helsinki as a stowaway; meanwhile, middle-aged salesman <>Wikström<\> ( <>Sakari Kuosmanen<\> ) leaves behind his wife and job and buys a conspicuously unprofitable seafood restaurant. After <>Khaled<\> is denied asylum, he decides not to return to Aleppo--and the paths of the two men cross fortuitously. As deadpan as the best of the director's work, and with a deep well of empathy for its down-but-not-out characters (many of them played by members of <>Kaurismäki<\> 's ever-reliable stock company), The Other Side of Hope is a bittersweet tale of human kindness in the face of official indifference.
