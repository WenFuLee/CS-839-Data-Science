<>Colin Farrell<\> stars as <>David<\> , a man who has just been dumped by his wife. To make matters worse, <>David<\> lives in a society where single people have 45 days to find true love, or else they are turned into the animal of their choice and released into the woods. <>David<\> is kept at the mysterious hotel while he searches for a new partner, and after several romantic misadventures decides to make a daring escape to abandon this world. He ultimately joins up with a rebel faction known as The Loners, a group founded on a complete rejection of romance. But once there <>David<\> meets an enigmatic stranger ( <>Rachel Weisz<\> ) who stirs up unexpected and strong feelings within him... At once a full immersion into a strange and surreal world, and a witty and clever reflection of our own society, THE LOBSTER is a thrillingly audacious vision fully brought to life by <>Lanthimos<\> and his terrific cast. The filmmaker displays a completely singular style and mastery of tone, finding the perfect balance between sharp-edged satire and romantic fable that entertains its audience while also leaving them with lots to reflect on long after the credits have rolled.
