- the names of all team members.
- the entity type that you have decided to extract, give a few examples of mentions of this entity type. 
- the total number of mentions that you have marked up.
- the number of documents in set I, the number of mentions in set I.
- the number of documents in set J, the number of mentions in set J. 
- the type of the classifier that you selected after performing cross validation on set I *the first time*, and the precision, recall, F1 of this classifier (on set I). This classifier is referred to as classifier M in the description above. 
- the type of the classifier that you have finally settled on *before* the rule-based postprocessing step, and the precision, recall, F1 of this classifier (on set J). This classifier is referred to as classifier X in the description above. 
- if you have done any rule-based post-processing, then give examples of rules that you have used, and describe where can we find all the rules (e.g., is it in the code directory somewhere?). 
- Report the precision, recall, F1 of classifier Y (see description above) on set J. This is the final classifier (plus rule-based post-processing if you have done any). 
- If you have not reached precision of at least 90% and recall of at least 60%, provide a discussion on why, and what else can you possibly do to improve the accuracy. 
- Provide any other information that you would like.
