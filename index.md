## Project Stage 1

1. [Original documents](https://github.com/WenFuLee/CS-839-Data-Science) 
- provide a 'README' file that tells us the entity type that you have marked up, ex. <>person's name<\>.
2. [Documents with markup](https://github.com/WenFuLee/CS-839-Data-Science) 
3. [Documents in set I](https://github.com/WenFuLee/CS-839-Data-Science)
4. [Documents in set J](https://github.com/WenFuLee/CS-839-Data-Science)
5. [Code](https://github.com/WenFuLee/CS-839-Data-Science)
6. [Compressed file, including all the files above](https://github.com/WenFuLee/CS-839-Data-Science)
7. [PDF Report](https://github.com/WenFuLee/CS-839-Data-Science) 
- the names of all team members.
- the entity type that you have decided to extract, give a few examples of mentions of this entity type. 
- the total number of mentions that you have marked up.
- the number of documents in set I, the number of mentions in set I.
- the number of documents in set J, the number of mentions in set J. 
- the type of the classifier that you selected after performing cross validation on set I *the first time*, and the precision, recall, F1 of this classifier (on set I). This classifier is referred to as classifier M in the description above. 
- the type of the classifier that you have finally settled on *before* the rule-based postprocessing step, and the precision, recall, F1 of this classifier (on set J). This classifier is referred to as classifier X in the description above. 
- if you have done any rule-based post-processing, then give examples of rules that you have used, and describe where can we find all the rules (e.g., is it in the code directory somewhere?). 
- Report the precision, recall, F1 of classifier Y (see description above) on set J. This is the final classifier (plus rule-based post-processing if you have done any). 
- If you have not reached precision of at least 90% and recall of at least 60%, provide a discussion on why, and what else can you possibly do to improve the accuracy. 
- Provide any other information that you would like. 
  

## Reference
You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/WenFuLee/CS-839_Data_Science/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/WenFuLee/CS-839_Data_Science/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
